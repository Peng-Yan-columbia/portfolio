# 🗺️ US Road Trip Planner Web App

An interactive, multi-page road-trip planning app that helps a group of travelers choose the best route, cities, and attractions across the United States.

The app is backed by a full ETL pipeline: we **extract**, **clean**, and **load** all location and rating data before it is used in any page of the application.

## 🚀 Core Features

- **Multi-page interactive web app**
  - Multiple tabs/pages (Overview, City Explorer, Map, Ranking, Itinerary, etc.).
  - Each page has dynamic outputs (tables, maps, plots) that respond to user inputs.
  - Some elements redirect users to other pages in the app or to external links (e.g., Google Maps / Yelp) for more details.

- **Predefined multi-city route**
  - Fixed route across several US cities (e.g., New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Roswell, Tucson, Malibu, Santa Monica, etc.).
  - City cards showing high-level stats: number of attractions, average rating, etc.

- **Interactive attraction map**
  - Map with clickable markers for each attraction.
  - Filter by city, category, rating, and/or price range.
  - Clicking a marker shows details and can redirect to external pages (e.g., official site, map directions).

- **Ranking & comparison dashboard**
  - Sortable tables that rank attractions by rating, popularity, or custom score.
  - City-to-city comparison (number of attractions, average rating, etc.).
  - Interactive controls that update outputs without reloading the page.

- **Group itinerary builder**
  - Select attractions and add them to a shared itinerary.
  - See the final list of stops per city with summary metrics (count, time, rough cost).
  - Buttons/links to jump between itinerary and other pages for refinement.

- **Data-driven backend (with ETL)**
  - All data is generated through an ETL pipeline before the app runs.
  - Cleaned data is stored in a structured format (database or processed CSVs).
  - The app never directly uses raw API/CSV responses.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

> Adjust this section to match your actual setup.

- **Frontend / App**
  - R [`shiny`](https://shiny.posit.co/) for the interactive multi-page web app  
  - `shinydashboard`, `bslib` or similar for layout and theming  
  - `leaflet` for maps, `plotly`/`ggplot2` for charts

- **Data / ETL**
  - R (`tidyverse`, `httr`, `jsonlite`, etc.) for ETL scripts
  - External APIs (e.g., Yelp / Google Places) or curated CSV datasets
  - SQL database (PostgreSQL / SQLite) **or** processed RDS/CSV files as the data source

- **Database Connectivity**
  - `DBI` + `RPostgres` / `RSQLite` to connect to the database

## 🧬 ETL Pipeline Overview

All data used in the app flows through a reproducible ETL pipeline:

1. **Extract**
   - Call APIs or read raw CSV/JSON files.
   - Save raw data to `data/raw/`.

2. **Transform**
   - Clean text fields, standardize categories, and handle missing values.
   - Remove duplicates and invalid coordinates.
   - Engineer features such as:
     - City-level stats (avg rating, # attractions)
     - Custom ranking scores (e.g., rating × review_count)
   - Save outputs to `data/processed/`.

3. **Load**
   - Create database tables using SQL scripts (`sql/create_tables.sql`), or write processed files.
   - Load the final tables into the database / data store used by the app.
   - All app pages read from these processed tables, not from raw data.

   - Optional voting/favoriting interactions:
     - Clicking a “Select” or “Add to Itinerary” button updates the itinerary page.
