## 🎯 Objective
Display ads are a major source of online traffic, and **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** is a key performance indicator.  
This project aims to:

- Understand CTR drivers through exploratory analysis  
- Engineer meaningful and transformed features  
- Apply and tune predictive models  
- Reduce RMSE through iterative modeling  
- Submit predictions to Kaggle leaderboard

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key steps taken:

### 1. Inspecting Predictors
- Reviewed variable descriptions and types  
- Checked unique levels, missing patterns, outliers  

### 2. Visual Diagnostics
- Histograms / KDE for skewed variables  
- Correlation heatmaps  
- Boxplots for pattern detection  

### 3. Transformation Candidates
- Mean centering  
- Log/sqrt transforms  
- Standardization  
- Missing-value imputation  
- One-hot encoding for categories

## 🧱 Feature Engineering
To avoid overfitting and improve predictive power, the project includes:

- Removal of non-predictive or sparse features  
- Reducing high-cardinality categories  
- Constructing scaled/centered numeric features  
- Deriving new interaction variables  
- Iteratively refining features after early modeling results  

---

## 🤖 Modeling Approach

Multiple models were trained and compared:

- Linear Models (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net)  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting / XGBoost / LightGBM  
- Neural Networks (optional)  

### Model Tuning
- Cross-validation  
- Grid/Random search  
- Early stopping (for boosting models)  
- Hyperparameter optimization targeting RMSE

## 📉 Evaluation Metric: RMSE
\[
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum(\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2}
\]

- Used for validation and Kaggle scoring  
- Final model selected based on lowest CV RMSE

## 🚀 Kaggle Submission
After selecting the best-performing model:

1. Predictions for the scoring dataset were generated  
2. Saved to `submission.csv` in required Kaggle format  
3. Uploaded to Kaggle for leaderboard evaluation
